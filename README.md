# Assembler-and-Emulator
This project is  implemented in C++, designed to simulate the assembly process and execution of programs. It features:   - Two-pass Assembler: Converts assembly code into machine code by performing PASS_1 and PASS_2 operations.   - Emulator: Executes the generated machine code, simulating the behavior of the target system.
